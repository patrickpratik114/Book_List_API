# Book_List_API

## This is a simple API project using Django Rest Framework where you can 'GET', "POST' and 'PUT'. To get to the API use "api/books" and from which you "GET" the already contained data and "POST" new data. If you use "api/books/(id)" replace the id with number such as 1, 2, 3 and it'll show you the data having that number as it's id.
